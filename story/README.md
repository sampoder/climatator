_**transition**_

Good morning, it's been an extraordinary year as unpredictable weather sweeps the globe. Today, we explore four stories from every corner of the planet on this climate special report.

_**transition**_

First, we take you to California, where wildfires are sweeping the state, covering it in an orange blanket. Over 4 million acres of land has burned and thousands of homes have been destroyed. Widespread blackouts have brought the state to a halt. Damages are predicted to be over $20 billion this year. Climate change, in the blunt words of one scientist, is smacking California in the face.

In Asia, a Category 5 tropical cyclone has hit Eastern India, specifically West Bengal, and also Bangladesh. With wide speeds reaching upwards of 120 miles per hour. The cyclone has generated over 914 mm or 36 inches of rainfall. Over 2 million Bangladeshis have been evacuated from their homes seeking safety from the destruction caused by the cyclone. With surface temperatures at an all time high, climate change has been blamed.

Travelling south, the people of the Maldives continue to struggle with the prospect that they may be citizens of a country with no land in the next few decades. Having already lost more then 20 islands to climate changes, rising sea levels could sink the island in under 30 years. The rate of rising sea levels has increased recently, leading the Maldives goverment to propose relocating the entire nations.

Lastly, Yemen's ongoing famine is being further fueled by a changing climate. Yemen's ability to grow its own food and access its own clean water is decreasing as the number of starving people grows. In recent years less rainfall, resulting in reduced harvests and therefore less produce for consumption. This is also causing more droughts which is creating a scarcity of drinking water. 

Thank you for watching this climate special report, after the break our very own Harold Hutchings sits down with climate expert Darrel Damian.

Did that all feel oddly familar?

That's because, all of that happened just last year not in 2050.

Climate change has already started to have an effect on people's lives, even yours. 

We must act now, before it's all to late.
