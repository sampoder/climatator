# Creating a SMART Goal

**Specific:** I will be creating a cinematic expirence that is contained to a room. The room will have a TV at the front, a chair in the middle and props surronding the chair. The TV will be playing a video, the props will be controlled via electronics and will be in sync with the video displayed. 

_Who?_ It will be targeted at those aged 16 and below. 

_Where?_ It will be semi-portable and displayed in the Personal Project exhibition.

_Why?_ To promote the effects of climate change and encourage people to take more action around climate change.

**Measurable:** This project should showcase at least 4 different effects of climate change with accompanying visuals and props. The expirence should last at least 2 minutes from entering the room to exiting. 

**Attainable:** I believe that this goal is attainable, I have prior experience in Python and limited experience in electronics. I have a reasonable amount of time to complete the goal, with this I plan to learn more to build on my knowledge. I also know quite a few people who know a lot about electronics.

**Relevant:** 2019 was the second warmest year on record based on NASA's data. It was just under 0.98 degrees C warmer than usual. We need action now. With 800 million people (a growing number) currently vulnerable to climate change's impact, this is extremely relevant.

**Timely:** I will complete the hardware project by Jan. 15. This will give me enough time to finish my written work.
