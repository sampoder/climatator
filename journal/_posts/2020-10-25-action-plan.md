What I will do over the next 7 weeks to make my project.

**Week 1**

_Action:_ In this week I will need to make the lower part of the capsule. This will mean making the bottom piece, then adding the palette that the seat will be attached to and then attaching the seat. I will do this in the design lab using a drill. I will be using wood as the material.

_Progress:_ 

**Week 2**

_Action:_ In this week I will building out the sides of the capsule, not including the door. I will also be doing this in the design lab with the wood and a drill. To end the week I will plan out how I will make the door.
