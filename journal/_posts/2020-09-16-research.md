summary: Key findings from my research
---

In this document, I'll be listing the key findings from me research and evaluating how they can be used.

## Primary research - TBD

Coming soon, I hope.

## Secondary research

I've also taken the time to research and learn more about Climate Change!

### A crash course on climate change, 50 years after the first Earth Day by the New York Times

_NYT Climate Desk. “Climate Crash Course Part 1: How Bad Is Climate Change Now?” New York Times, 20 Apr. 2020, www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/19/climate/climate-crash-course-1.html._

#### The current situation

* Arctic is warming rapidly. "Last year, average air temperatures were about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.9 degrees Celsius, higher than the average from 1981-2010."
* Rest of the world is also warming up.
* Feedback loops: as ice melts less light is reflected and therefore more heat is absorbed which warms up the waters causing more ice to melt.
* Antarctica is also having ice melt. Mainly through the calving of icebergs and melting of the undersides of ice shelves, however.
* As the Arctic melts, the polar jet stream is disrupted. This causes extreme weather.
  * This is because high-pressure air zones are created, these zones stall weather systems.
* "What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic."

#### Scientific Evidence

* The second warmest year on record was 2019
  * Direct measurements of the earth temperature start in 1800s
  * Prior to that, the average temperature is found indirectly through ice core samples, tree rings, corals, pollen and cave deposits.
* Ocean temperatures hit a high in 2019 as well

#### Influence & our leaders

* Lot's of lobbying slows down change
* Fossil fuels industry is powerful, and performs a lot of lobbying
  * Lobbied against policies to tackle global warming
  * Obscured established scientific research
* The USA is going backwards (article is US-centric)
  * President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord
  * The White House also halted the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan after lobbying from coalcompanies such as Peabody Energy 
  * In the USA, oil and gas indsutries spent $125 million in federal lobbying

#### What we can do

* Clean up electric power plants with renewable alternatives
  * Case studies to explore: California, France, South Australia.
  * Would cut one-quarter of global emissions
* Go electric, whereever possible
  * Examples: electric cars, electric heat pumps & electric furnaces
  * Would cut one-quarter of global emissions
