## Interview With Lachlan Campbell


**Location Of Source:** Digital Interview

**Date Accessed:** 23/09/2020

**Source Type:** Primary

**ATL Skills Used:** Communication

### Authority

The information is being presented through an interview with [Lachlan Campbell](https://lachlanjc.com/). They are providing this information based on prior experience and their knowledge.

They are the Head of Storytelling @ Hack Club and they are studying Interactive Media Arts at New York University. They work on web design and development projects, mainly.

They’ve built popular activism projects that help raise awareness for important global issues. These include [Predict COVID-19](https://predictcovid.com) & [Gun Funded](https://gunfunded.com). Recently, they built a [CO2 tracker](https://co2.now.sh) which is very relevant to my project.

Whilst they aren’t your traditional expert, I would certainly consider them to be one. They’ve got loads of experience in telling stories through multimedia. They’ve built apps used by thousands of users around the world.

I think they’re views are important as they’re someone who knows how to connect with people about important global issues. They’re also a young person and climate change affects the youth the most.

### Accuracy

We can’t verify the information, as the interview focused on collecting their experiences from telling stories about global issues. 

However we can verify Lachlan’s experience, through their [résumé](https://lachlanjc.com/resume) and their [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lachlanjc) (where they host their projects). 

### Objectivity

This was a very opinion based interview, due to the framing off my questions. When asking the questions, I wanted to get a really unique and insightful perspective. There was also an emotional aspect as I know that Lachlan cares a lot about environmental warming (like me). 

There was also a personal bias, as we all have different experiences. However, I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing.

As this wasn’t a fact-focus source I can’t verify them. 

### Currency

This information is quite recent as the interview only took place on the 23rd of September and Lachlan is very involved with the latest trends.

### Value

I found it extremely valuable getting to speak to Lachlan, they’re a very good storyteller and their wisdom will help me succeed! 

They provided very detailed answers that they had put a lot of effort into.

They have a lot of expirence with activism through technology.

Whilst facts help me better understand the situation, Lachlan has provided me with one of the kind advice. I’m super grateful that they took the time to help out.
