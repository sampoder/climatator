# Personal Project Draft Proposal 2020-2021

### Project Topic

Displaying the effects of Climate Change on our future planet in an interactive manner.

### Global Context

- [ ] Scientific and technical innovation
- [ ] Personal and cultural expression
- [ ] Fairness and development
- [x] Globalisation and sustainability
- [ ] Identities and relationships
- [ ] Orientation in space and time

### Why did you choose this global context?

Climate change is approaching rapidly. Without action in the next five years our planet will be on a path of inevitable doom. I choose this global context as it directly relates to the challenges we'll be facing this year. 

To reverse climate change, we will need to work together as a planet. We will need to seak out sustainable alternatives to our lifestyle. Examples of which would switching away from single use plastics and non-renewable energy.
