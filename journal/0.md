# Personal Project Draft Proposal 2020-2021

### Project Topic

Displaying the effects of Climate Change on our future planet in an interactive manner.

### Global Context

- [ ] Scientific and technical innovation
- [ ] Personal and cultural expression
- [ ] Fairness and development
- [x] Globalisation and sustainability
- [ ] Identities and relationships
- [ ] Orientation in space and time

### Why did you choose this global context?

Climate change is approaching rapidly. Without action in the next five years our planet will be on a path of inevitable doom. I choose this global context as it directly relates to the challenges we'll be facing this year. 

To reverse climate change, we will need to work together as a planet. We will need to seak out sustainable alternatives to our lifestyle. Examples of which would switching away from single use plastics and non-renewable energy.

### Proposed Goal/Inquiry Question

In this personal project, I'd like to create a product that displays the effect that climate change will have on the planet in the future. The product should do so an interactive way that speaks to those under 18. It should also display the information in a consise way to prevent user boredem. 

### Personal Interest in Topic

Over the past few years, I've learnt a lot about climate change and its effects. I'm personally worried about what a world in 2050 would look like.
